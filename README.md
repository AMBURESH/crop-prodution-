# crop-prodution-
This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts total crop production based on user inputs: harvested area, crop yield, and year. The app also provides a performance evaluation of the underlying machine learning model (Gradient Boosting Regressor).

Predict Production

Estimate total crop production (in tons) based on:

.Area Harvested (in hectares)

.Yield (kg/ha)

.Year

Model Performance

Evaluate the model’s performance using:

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
